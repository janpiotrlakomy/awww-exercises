Fortran is a third generation, compiled, imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. Fortran was originally developed by IBM. It first compiled correctly in 1958. Fortran computer programs have been written to support scientific and engineering applications, such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, geophysics, computational physics, crystallography and computational chemistry. It is a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers. Fortran has evolved through numerous versions and dialects. In 1966, the American National Standards Institute developed a standard for Fortran because new compilers would slightly change the syntax.
