Delphi is a general-purpose programming language and a software product that uses the Delphi dialect of the Object Pascal programming language and provides an integrated development environment for rapid application development of desktop, mobile, web, and console software, currently developed and maintained by Embarcadero Technologies. Delphi's compilers generate native code for Microsoft Windows, macOS, iOS, Android and Linux. Delphi includes a code editor, a visual designer, an integrated debugger, a source code control component, and support for third-party plugins. The code editor features Code Insight, Error Insight, and refactoring. The visual forms designer has the option of using either the Visual Component Library for pure Windows development or the FireMonkey framework for cross-platform development. Database support is a key feature and is provided by FireDAC. Delphi is known for its fast compilation speed, native code, and developer productivity.
