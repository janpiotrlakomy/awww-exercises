A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs. Programming languages are described in terms of their syntax and semantics, usually defined by a formal language. Most languages have a type system consisting of different data types and catch type errors where one type is given where another is expected. Many support user-defined types including abstract data types, often used for object-oriented programming. Implementation in the form of a compiler or interpreter allows programs to be translated into machine code and executed. Computer architecture has strongly influenced the design of programming languages, with the most common type developed to perform well on the popular von Neumann architecture. While early programming languages were closely tied to the hardware, over time, they have developed more abstraction to hide implementation details for greater simplicity.
